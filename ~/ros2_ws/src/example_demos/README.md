- UI control panels provide professional-grade interfaces for research and development

## Troubleshooting

### No Camera Found
If you see "No camera found", check:
1. Camera is connected and working
2. Camera driver/node is running
3. Topic name matches expected patterns

### Demo Won't Start
Ensure the package is built and sourced:
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select example_demos
source install/setup.bash
```

### Performance Issues
If the demo runs slowly:
1. Close other applications using the camera
2. Reduce image resolution if possible
3. Check system resources (CPU/memory)

### UI Panel Issues
1. **Tkinter not found**: Install python3-tk
2. **PIL errors**: Install pillow package
3. **Slow UI updates**: Reduce detection frequency in settings

### Self-Driving Demo Issues
1. **Lane not detected**: Ensure good lighting and clear lane markings
2. **Erratic steering**: Adjust PID parameters in the code
3. **Signs not recognized**: Check sign visibility and contrast

### Data Export Problems
1. **Permission errors**: Check write permissions in target directory
2. **Large file sizes**: Reduce image quality or detection frequency
3. **Missing data**: Ensure recording is enabled before starting detection
